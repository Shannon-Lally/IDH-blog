### Movie Night: An Exercise in Conversion

After a long week of papers, exams, quizzes, and more papers, a friend (we shall call her Friend) invited me over for a movie night. Instead of partaking in a stereotypical Friday night of stress-induced debauchery with the rest of our college peers, we plopped down on the sofa in our sweatpants with a large mixing bowl full of pizza-flavored goldfish. Friend had recently been through a very rough breakup, and so she asked me to pick a movie that would not rub too much salt in her wounds. While I would like to pretend I was a good friend and chose something that had absolutely nothing to do with heartbreak, I had already made up my mind before even crossing the threshold of her apartment that we would be watching *Pride and Prejudice* (2005).  For the first ten or so minutes of the movie, Friend scrolled through Instagram and caught up on her Snapchat streaks, subtly trying her best to remain uninvested, but by the end of the movie, she was scrolling through tumblr for P&P memes and sending them to me across the sofa. Perhaps this is giving too much credit to a simple story of 18<sup>th</sup> century English domesticity, but Friend was a changed woman. As the credits rolled, she said, "I was dating a Wickham when I could have been dating a Darcy or even a Bingley. Time to make a Tinder!" This felt oddly like her hitting the bullseye and and missing the mark entirely at the same time. Nonetheless, I was happy to have converted yet another person to the cult of Austen.

Friend was not the first unsuspecting victim of my Austen fanatacism. No, my reign of terror began with my mother sitting me down when I was seven years old to watch *Pride and Prejudice* (2005). Although I didn't understand most of the plot, I knew I liked it. This turned into a downward spiral of consuming every Austen adaptation I could get my hands on, even the oddballs like *Clueless* (1995), *Austenland* (2013), *Bride and Prejudice* (2004), and *Pride and Prejudice and Zombies* (2016). Eventually, my love for Jane Austen's works was too great to contain, so I had to force it upon other people. 

While I love Austen's original novels, I almost never recommend the books themselves when to people I try to spread the gospel of Miss Austen to the masses. Does this make me some kind of Jane Austen traitor? To be determined. Janeites far more strict than myself would likely brand this post heretical, but that will not stop me. I do understand the reverence that has thus far reigned supreme in academia and driven a movement to preserve and digitize original texts, in this post, but I will argue that adaptations have their places in a corpus beside their origin text predecessors and even greatly enhance our understanding of the stories. Adaptations of original texts are simply evolution: one is not necessarily better than the other. In fact, they coexist and even benefit from each other's existence. Adaptations, however, have arisen to the occasion of changing with the times, which is something original texts are incapable of. 

### Embalming the Corpus

While Jane Austen only managed to publish six finished novels in her lifetime, including *Pride and Prejudice*, *Sense and Sensibility*, *Persuasion*, *Northanger Abbey*, *Mansfield Park*, and *Emma*, her corpus of handwritten letters and manuscripts is actually quite extensive. Many of these manuscripts are of Austen's unfinished works, like the manuscript that would eventually be called *Sanditon* (which was recently made into a popular miniseries, I might add). One of the largest current efforts to reunite and preserve Austen's manuscripts is the [Jane Austen's Fiction Manuscripts Digital Edition](https://janeausten.ac.uk/index.html). This project currently boasts "some 1100 pages of fiction written in Jane Austen’s own hand" according to their website (check it out [here](https://janeausten.ac.uk/index.html)). This is quite impressive, as many of Jane Austen's manuscripts were distributed across the world posthumously, so there has never really been a complete picture of Austen's literary prowess all in one place. In fact, it is assumed she threw away or destroyed the manuscripts for several of her novels that were publsihed while she was alive, so even this is not a finished collection ([Jane Austen's Fiction Manuscripts Digital Edition: The Edition](https://janeausten.ac.uk/edition/intro.html). Fortunately, this collection has left no stone unturned and has made what is likely the most comprehensive Austen archive ever. Not only are the manuscripts now huddled together in the same archival space, but they are accessible to anyone with an internet connection. For the first time since Austen's death, her remaining manuscripts are together again, even if they are oceans apart. An added benefit of digitization is that whatever goes into the archive will exist exactly as it was in the moment it was scanned forever. It has become immortal. While writing itself is often thought of as an immortalizing act because the text will be reproduced and exist indefinitely, the original manuscripts themselves are quite frail. Digitizing them allows not only the stories to remain frozen in time, but the physical manuscripts as well.

The question is: are these texts really static? While Jane Austen's words themselves will never change, the way we engage with her writing as a culture has changed drastically. Looking at the digital archive, it feels incomplete, at least with my modern biases. How can a corpus be complete if it's missing an arm or a leg? Could the new, modern takes on Austen's works that I've loved since childhood be included in a Janeite corpus? Are films based off of her movies literature? Where is the line? In "Off the Page Literature on Film, TV and the Stage" from his book [*A Little History of Literature*](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.neu.edu/stable/pdf/j.ctt5vkwh2.34.pdf?ab_segments=0%252Fbasic_search_SYC-5462%252Fcontrol&refreqid=excelsior%3Af91e3166b5ae3a3c1ceef33752b896e7), John Sutherland says, 
>"‘Literature’, as you will know, literally means something that comes
to us in the form of letters. That is, something written or printed
and taken in through the eye to be interpreted by the brain. But
often enough, particularly nowadays, literature comes to us ‘mediated’, in different forms and through different channels and different sense organs" ([Sutherland](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.neu.edu/stable/pdf/j.ctt5vkwh2.34.pdf?ab_segments=0%252Fbasic_search_SYC-5462%252Fcontrol&refreqid=excelsior%3Af91e3166b5ae3a3c1ceef33752b896e7), 208).

By this definition of literature he sets forth, adaptations are just a new form of literature, so I think there's definitely a place for literary adaptations in a Janeite corpus. If you want to understand Jane Austen as she was, then perhaps the [Jane Austen's Fiction Manuscripts Digital Edition](https://janeausten.ac.uk/index.html) is enough for you, but if you want to understand Jane Austen as she is today, you should probably broaden your horizons a bit. 

### Manuscript &#8594; Novel &#8594; Film

Something odd that I have never given much thought is that our generation is one of the first that experiences original texts and film adaptations simultaneously, despite them sometimes being conceived hundreds of years apart. I saw *Pride and Prejudice* (2005) long before I read the book, and that really changed how I read the novel. Because I already knew the basics, I was able to focus on the little things that I might have missed if I had been new to the story. Adaptations of texts are informative, but complicated to study formally, especially since their very validity is often criticized and questioned.

The journey from book to film has been millenia in the making, and it appears as if a concensus on the value of analyzing adaptations in the context of their original works is going at the same snail's pace. Adaptation studies is present in the academic conversation, though. In "[Texts, Technologies, and Intertextualities: Film Adaptation in a Postmodern World](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.neu.edu/stable/pdf/43797653.pdf?ab_segments=0%252Fbasic_search_SYC-5462%252Fcontrol&refreqid=excelsior%3Ac778905a449541040bfaf5340fde2cb1)," Ian Olney delves into the technological changes driving adaptation and the nuances of adaptation studies. Olney mentions a concept Sutherland also discusses: fidelity. He says,
> "Until fairly recently,  discourse in the field of adaptation studies mostly revolved around the question of
 fidelity: film adaptations were evaluated based upon how faithful they were to their
 source texts. An adaptation that hewed closely to its literary parent was assessed
 favorably; an adaptation that strayed was judged harshly... The postmodern condition, though, poses a
 significant challenge to this belief" ([Olney](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.neu.edu/stable/pdf/43797653.pdf?ab_segments=0%252Fbasic_search_SYC-5462%252Fcontrol&refreqid=excelsior%3Ac778905a449541040bfaf5340fde2cb1), 168-169).

While it can be useful to judge text and film adaptations by how closely they resemble their originals, it can also be harmful to the analytic process, as some of the most startling discoveries can arise from the very differences that fidelity-fixation condemns. Olney rebels against the idea that texts are forever bound to their author and their original form. He says,
 
>   "Finally, Roland Barthes's proclamation of the
 'death of the author' strikes a blow not only against the presumed authority of the
 writer, but also against the presumed autonomy of a literary work" ([Olney](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.neu.edu/stable/pdf/43797653.pdf?ab_segments=0%252Fbasic_search_SYC-5462%252Fcontrol&refreqid=excelsior%3Ac778905a449541040bfaf5340fde2cb1), 169).

Once a text is put out into the world, it is an entity that interacts with its current context, whatever that may be. It is free to transform, grow, progress, regress, or whatever is asked of it at the time. The author, despite their role in its creation, cannot ask their work to stand still for all of time. Adaptation is bound to happen, and instead of fighting it, we should celebrate it and study the contexts that bring it about.
  
### The Janeitism Schism

Period dramas seem to increasingly capture people's imagination as they become more and more foreign to our current reality. A period drama may not have been so exciting to read in the 1920s, but in the age of technology, they have taken on a new kind of nostalgia. Because of this longing for the past, adaptations keep on being made, taking Austen's plots and spinning them out in every possible direction. This spinning is exponential: the more adaptations are made, the more drastic the changes have to be to present a new take on old material. Even Austen herself received the Hollywood treatment in the biopic *Becoming Jane* (2007). Many of these adaptations have become timeless cult classics of their own, such as *Clueless* (1995), but they've also had quite the polarizing effect. To every light there is a darkness, and to every adaptation lover, there is a hater. More traditionally rigid Janeities tore *Clueless* (1995) apart, for example, which takes the plot of Austen's novel *Emma* and transplants it into a modern teen drama.

There are those, however, who embrace contemporary takes on classic literature with open arms. In "A Consideration of Times and Seasons: Two Jane Austen Adaptations," Laura Carroll makes the case for *Clueless* (1995), saying
> "Regarding *Metropolitan* and *Clueless*, it is perhaps not completely disingenuous to point out that Austen's works were not period dramas when she wrote and published them. From here, it is just a small conceptual step to importing elements of the novels into contemporary spaces, and to reconceiving traditional grist to the costume drama mill as material that works beautifully inside modern, popular genres and conventions" ([Carroll](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.neu.edu/stable/pdf/43797118.pdf?ab_segments=0%252Fbasic_search_SYC-5462%252Fcontrol&refreqid=excelsior%3A394ee1134389c4a4358aa6a04f7198b6), 169). 

Carroll's point that Jane Austen's works are only period dramas in retrospect is particularly helpful. At the time *Emma* was published, it was just as modern as *Clueless* (1995) was when it was released in theaters. Forcing a text to abide by the rules of a genre that it was not even a part of to begin with seems almost ridiculous, but that is unlikely to convince traditional Janeities to raise a white flag and surrender. Despite their objections, however, adaptations will continue to multiply, and there is nothing they can do to stop progress. 

### An American Happily Ever After?

Something that stirred up quite the controversy in the Austen community when *Pride and Prejudice* (2005) came out was that the film had two endings. The British version of the film ended with Mr. Bennett giving his blessing for Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth to marry, while the American film added an extra scene showing Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth settling into their lives as a married couple. They even kiss (how scandalous), which is the only kiss to occur in the entire film! It was romantic, and people were up in arms. What was the fuss? Aren't Austen's stories supposed to be romantic? What seemed to bother people was simply that the American version was decidedly not how Elizabeth and Darcy's story explicitly ended in the novel, even if it was heavily implied. Some Janeites decided it's the British way or the highway! It was an unusually divisive and confusing choice, which begs the question of why a special version was shown to American audiences. While many movies and shows shoot multiple endings, they hardly ever simultaneously release said various endings.

Apparently, the producers had some sort of preconceived notion that Americans and the British have different needs when it comes to the old fashioned "happily ever after." It seems that the producers thought Americans would be more satisfied with a realistic depiction of a couple, while the British would be more concerned with remaining true to Austen's original, chaste masterpiece. While the new ending was popular with test audiences, it is unclear how this original American-British schism found its way into the writing room ([United Press International](https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2005/11/15/Pride-and-Prejudice-has-two-endings/86001132087874/#:~:text=15%20(UPI)%20%2D%2D%20U.S.%20moviegoers,version%20of%20the%20same%20film.&text=The%20U.S.%20version%20ends%20with,he%20repeatedly%20sighs%20her%20name.)). One can guess that the British ending was meant to emulate the BBC adaptation of *Pride and Prejudice* (1995), which to this day is still the favored and fiercely protected adaptation. See the 1995 and 2005 DVD cover images, respectively. The American (2005) version (right) is clearly hazy, dramatic, and filled with romantic tension, while the British (1995) version (left) lacks the tension and flair that makes the American version seem so inviting.

While your average viewer likely found the American ending to be more satisfying (because who watches a romantic drama where the couple doesn't even kiss),  British and American Janeites alike were outraged and absolutely scandalized by the embellished ending. Elsa Solender, the former president of the Jane Austen Society of North America, made a rather scathing statement saying, 
> "It has nothing at all of Jane Austen in it, is inconsistent with the first two-thirds of the film, insults the audience with its banality, and ought to be cut before release" ([United Press International](https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2005/11/15/Pride-and-Prejudice-has-two-endings/86001132087874/#:~:text=15%20(UPI)%20%2D%2D%20U.S.%20moviegoers,version%20of%20the%20same%20film.&text=The%20U.S.%20version%20ends%20with,he%20repeatedly%20sighs%20her%20name.)).

Spoiler alert: the ending was not cut. So was the American ending a mistake? An error? An abomination? Academically, should this ending be ignored as an anomoly never to be spoken of again? I would argue the opposite. Mutations and divergences away from the original text are just a form of cultural evolution, and what is evolution if not a series of happy accidents?

While the two endings were supposed to cater to British and American audiences, perhaps they actually catered to those with more modern sensibilities and those who would rather dig their heels in and stick to the traditional Austen ending. The old guard vs. the new guard. If the scripts for both versions of these movies were converted into text, which could be included in a Jane Austen archive? I would like to make the argument that both have their place alongside their source material. I even think it would be interesting to see what differences are written into a script in the stage directions, a part of the adaptation the audience never even sees. 

While many academics stubbornly remain faithful to the integrity of the original texts, many academics are broadening the field of literary analysis to include adaptations. While this does not necessarily inform readers on Austen's novels verbatim, it does open up the study of Jane Austen to new, modern audiences and demographics. While the novel *Pride and Prejudice* may tell us about the specific cultural moment in 1813, *Pride and Prejudice* (2005), *Pride and Prejudice and Zombies* (2016), and even *Clueless* (1995) lend insight into Austen's influence in the current cultural moment. These adaptations show a lot has changed since 1813, but many things have also remained the same. These cultural shifts, and/or lack thereof, deserve to be considered alongside their source material. Even *Sanditon* (2019), the devastatingly unfinished miniseries, brings new light to Austenian practices. Fans of the series went absolutely rabid when the series was not renewed, ending on a massive cliffhanger. What this tells us is that Austen's works are notable for always having happy endings. When an adaptation of her work does not have one, it throws a huge monkey wrench in the literary machine because an Austen story *must* have a happy ending (although apparently not too happy of an ending, as it might upset the British). This has not changed since Austen was alive. If adaptations illuminate culture, what does adding a kiss at the end of *Pride and Prejudice* (2005) tell us about our current cultural moment, or even simultaneous cultural moments in two separate continents? 

A great example of this can be also found in [DSC #2: Katia and the Phantom Corpus](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dsc2/) of [The Data-Sitters Club](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/). When doing a bit of textual analysis, Katherine Bowers finds some odd updates to the original text. She notes, 
> “She pressed a few keys, waited a moment, then reached around to the side of the computer and touched something or other that made the screen go blank.” turned into “She pressed a few keys, waited a moment, then touched something or other that made the screen go blank.” (This one surprised me: I’m not sure I would’ve thought to edit out the “reaching around to the side of the computer” to account for the different dimensions and conventions of modern vs. 1980’s computers.)>  "One might argue that because adaptation is characterized by
 an engagement with and reproduction of earlier texts, it is ideally suited to postmodern
 retrospection" ([Bowers](https://datasittersclub.github.io/site/dsc2/)).
 
 Here is a great example of a shift in culture making itself known in what is otherwise the same text. If aliens were to come to Earth and learn human culture through the Baby-sitters Club books, they would see changes like this and know that at one point computers were big and bulky, and then they were not. Austen adaptations bring the same kind of cultural timeline to the table. Even within the individual texts themselves, there are certainly minute modifications. While I only own three versions of *Pride and Prejudice*, I have noticed very subtle differences between them, even if it just comes down to the spelling of a single word. A quick search on Project Gutenberg reveals more sublte changes, so digitized versions of the text are also undergoing alterations. If these textual changes within the books are notable and valuable, so are the changes that occur outside of the books in the various film adaptations. While the DSC example is a text to text comparison, I believe that Sutherland's definition of literature allows textual comparison between novels and films, as they are both literature, or at the very least literature-esque or literature-adjacent. 
 
If someone ever makes a corpus incorporating not only all of Austen's known writing, but also every adaptation that has ever come from that writing, I would love to get my hands on it. It would likely be far more interesting than Austen's manuscripts by themselves. When deciding what goes into a corpus or not, purity should not be the only determining factor. What is fidelity really worth anyway? I think John Sutherland puts it perfectly when he says,
> "‘Fidelity’, one concludes, is as tricky in art as it is in
our love-lives" ([Sutherland](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.neu.edu/stable/pdf/j.ctt5vkwh2.34.pdf?ab_segments=0%252Fbasic_search_SYC-5462%252Fcontrol&refreqid=excelsior%3Af91e3166b5ae3a3c1ceef33752b896e7), 212).

### P.S.

I added years behind all of the adaptations I discuss because there are many, and it can get confusing. I also may have over cited/linked, but I wanted to make sure the articles could be checked out at any point in the post. Thanks!
